        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tamp your coffee grinds in a porter filter, ensuring a level flat surface.</li>
            <li>Extract a shot of espresso, between 20-30ml, with your filled porter filter and an espresso machine</li>
            <li>Steam your milk to around 60°C or 140°F, allowing enough air into it to create some microfoam, but ensuring that it’s stretched and silky.</li>
            <li>Pour between 40–60 ml of milk onto the espresso at a slight angle with a bit of height to integrate the espresso with the milk.</li>
            <li>Add a small layer of foam on the top.</li>
            <li>Voilà! Your Piccolo is complete.</li>
